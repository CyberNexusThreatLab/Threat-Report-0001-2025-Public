#### Summary

Our investigation into the recent breach at **CyberABCLab** reveals that the **PhantomCiphers** group gained initial access via a **compromised employee email account**, enabling internal reconnaissance and credential harvesting. The attack chain demonstrates usage of common MITRE ATT\&CK TTPs, particularly focused on credential-based lateral movement and stealthy persistence mechanisms.

#### MITRE ATT\&CK Mapping ‚Äì Initial Access

| Tactic             | Technique                         | ID        | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Access** | **Valid Accounts**                | T1078     | Attackers used valid credentials belonging to `esharpe@cyberabclab.com`, likely obtained through prior phishing or password reuse across services. |
| **Initial Access** | **Phishing (Spearphishing Link)** | T1566.002 | Email logs indicate a malicious link sent to a developer on 2025-04-18, leading to a credential harvesting page mimicking Microsoft 365.           |
| **Execution**      | **User Execution**                | T1204.002 | An HR staff member clicked a fake ‚Äúpayroll update‚Äù link and entered credentials on a spoofed portal.                                               |
| **Persistence**    | **Web Shell**                     | T1505.003 | Web server logs show an unauthorized PHP file uploaded to `/var/www/devpanel/test.php` two days prior to ransomware detonation.                    |

#### üõ† Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

* Suspicious login: `esharpe@cyberabclab.com` from IP `185.234.53.91` (Tor exit node)
* Phishing domain: `cyberabclab-payroll[.]com`
* Web shell hash: `f3a12c...` (SHA256)
* Access token: `ATHENA-TEMP-0424!` used on internal VPN endpoints

#### üß© Analyst Note

The use of **valid employee credentials** combined with spearphishing is consistent with PhantomCiphers‚Äô prior tactics against other mid-sized tech firms. The group favors minimal tooling in early stages and often blends into legitimate user activity to evade detection.

#### üîö Recommendation

* Immediate password reset for all staff.
* Disable unused admin panels (e.g., `/dev/admin_login`).
* Implement conditional MFA based on geolocation.
* Review logs for external access to `admin.cyberabclab.com` and VPN IPs.
